# Create a Base Directory for Scripts
- I use `c:\development\robot-scripts`
- Each Robor Framework project will have its own directory
  - `c:\development\robot-scripts\*project1*`
  - `c:\development\robot-scripts\*project2*`
- Open Pycharm and create a new project in `c:\development\robot-scripts`
